# Weather Dashboard 

## Purpose
To create a weather dashboard that checks the current temperature and the 5 day forecast of the city searched by the user. Data on temperature, UV Index, humidity, and wind speed are presented to the user. The user can also see previous searches they made and click on those past searches and see the weather data again. The app uses the Open Weather API--both the One Call API and the 5 Day/ 3 Hour Forecast API's. 

## My Experience
I wanted to challenge myself by having I dynamically created the html content that the data populated on the page using vanilla JavaScript. This app was very extensive-- I learned a lot and it reinforced a lot of previous lessons. Building this app made me a stronger coder. New bugs popped up with every bout of progress. I feel very comfortable dealing with arrays and objects and especially extracting data from API's. 

## Technologies Used
- Open Weather API 
- Moment.js
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Local Storage was used

Weather Dashboard Assignment
# Purpose
To create a weather dashboard that checks the current temperature and the 5 day forecast of the city searched by the user. Data on temperature, UV Index, humidity, and wind speed are presented to the user. The user can also see previous searches they made and click on those past searches and see the weather data again. 
# My Experience
I wanted to challenge myself by having I dynamically created the html content that the data populated on the page using vanilla JavaScript. I thought this assignment was very extensive-- I learned a lot and it reinforced a lot of previous lessons.This assignment made me a stronger coder. New bugs popped up with every bout of progress. I feel very comfortable dealing with arrays and objects and especially extracting data from API's. I struggled with keeping data and variables in the global scope.
